They were worried that they would get in trouble for not watching the child closely enough. After a few tense moments, they decided to rinse the child’s eye with water instead of going to the emergency room.\n\n*Version 2*\n\nIn a bright kitchen, a young child accidentally splashed bleach into their eye, the sharp sting making tears flow down their cheeks. The air filled with the harsh smell of chemicals as the child cried out in pain. Their older sibling stood frozen, heart racing, torn between the urgency of seeking help and the fear of getting in trouble for not watching closely enough. The clock ticked loudly, each second stretching painfully as they weighed their options. Finally, with a deep breath, they rushed to the sink, turning on the cold water, hoping it would wash away both the bleach and their worries.\\\n\n-   Storyboard Exercise\n\n    -   Finish the above story with an ending of your choice\n    -   Focus on imagery you want to evoke reader / viewer / listener senses\n\n### Talk about Story Analysis Assignment\n\n-   See Canvas\n\n# October 1, 2024 (Tuesday)\n\n## Schedule for Today\n\n-   Career Fair Follow Up\n\n-   Persuasive Stories\n\n-   Story Analysis Workshop\n\n### Career Fair Follow Up\n\n-   Thoughts?\n\n### Persuasive Stories\n\n-   6 Rules for Persuasive Storytelling <https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persuasive-storytelling/>\n\n-   Lawyer Example (Canvas)\n\n-   Stand Up to Cancer\n\n    {{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDZ--Tb09mk >}}\n\n    More info: <https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2024/American-Airlines-and-Stand-Up-To-Cancer-SU2C-campaign-takes-off-to-accelerate-funding-for-cancer-research-COMM-VOL-08/default.aspx>\n\n### Story Analysis Q & A\n\n# October 3, 2024 (Thursday)\n\n## Schedule for Today\n\n-   Persuasive Stories (contd.)\n\n-   Story Analysis Workshop\n\n### Persuasive Stories\n\n#### Embedding Facts in Stories\n\n-   Strong facts\n\n-   Weak facts\n\n-   Examples\n\n*Trulicity Facts and Ad*\n\nFacts: <https://www.goodrx.com/trulicity/what-is>\n\nAd:\n\n![](images/trulicity.png)\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xipiotOLGDY>}}\n\n*Student Choice (Ad)*\n\n#### Writing a Commercial Video Script\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDlUVbQTsso >}}\n\n### Story Analysis Workshop\n\n# October 8, 2024 (Tuesday)\n\n## Schedule for Today\n\n-   Storytelling Ethics\n-   Research Logs\n\n### \n\n### Storytelling Ethics\n\n#### Telling Stories from Real Life\n\n-   Queensburg and Brooks (2010) Recommendations\n\n![](images/ethics-of-stories.png){fig-alt=\"cover page chapter on ethics of stories in queensburg and brooks, 2010\"}\n\n-   Henrietta Lacks Example\n\nTrailer for Film\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jxEX1XQpY >}}\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jxEX1XQpY>\n\nExcerpt\n\n![](images/immortal-henrietta-excerpt.png){fig-alt=\"page from immortal life of henrietta lacks book\"}\n\nDialect\n\n::: callout-note\n## \"I’ve done my best to capture the language with which each person spoke and wrote: dialogue appears in native dialects; passages from diaries and other personal writings are quoted exactly as written.\n\n## As one of Henrietta’s relatives said to me, 'If you pretty up how people spoke and change the things they said, that’s dishonest.

It is human nature to expect that anyone out to influence others has something to gain. Most people subconsciously assume your gain will mean their loss. This is human nature. We instinctually erect barriers and suspicions to protect ourselves.

They were worried that they would get in trouble for not watching the child closely enough. After a few tense moments, they decided to rinse the child’s eye with water instead of going to the emergency room.\n\n*Version 2*\n\nIn a bright kitchen, a young child accidentally splashed bleach into their eye, the sharp sting making tears flow down their cheeks. The air filled with the harsh smell of chemicals as the child cried out in pain. Their older sibling stood frozen, heart racing, torn between the urgency of seeking help and the fear of getting in trouble for not watching closely enough. The clock ticked loudly, each second stretching painfully as they weighed their options. Finally, with a deep breath, they rushed to the sink, turning on the cold water, hoping it would wash away both the bleach and their worries.\\\n\n-   Storyboard Exercise\n\n    -   Finish the above story with an ending of your choice\n    -   Focus on imagery you want to evoke reader / viewer / listener senses\n\n### Talk about Story Analysis Assignment\n\n-   See Canvas\n\n# October 1, 2024 (Tuesday)\n\n## Schedule for Today\n\n-   Career Fair Follow Up\n\n-   Persuasive Stories\n\n-   Story Analysis Workshop\n\n### Career Fair Follow Up\n\n-   Thoughts?\n\n### Persuasive Stories\n\n-   6 Rules for Persuasive Storytelling <https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persuasive-storytelling/>\n\n-   Lawyer Example (Canvas)\n\n-   Stand Up to Cancer\n\n    {{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDZ--Tb09mk >}}\n\n    More info: <https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2024/American-Airlines-and-Stand-Up-To-Cancer-SU2C-campaign-takes-off-to-accelerate-funding-for-cancer-research-COMM-VOL-08/default.aspx>\n\n### Story Analysis Q & A\n\n# October 3, 2024 (Thursday)\n\n## Schedule for Today\n\n-   Persuasive Stories (contd.)\n\n-   Story Analysis Workshop\n\n### Persuasive Stories\n\n#### Embedding Facts in Stories\n\n-   Strong facts\n\n-   Weak facts\n\n-   Examples\n\n*Trulicity Facts and Ad*\n\nFacts: <https://www.goodrx.com/trulicity/what-is>\n\nAd:\n\n![](images/trulicity.png)\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xipiotOLGDY>}}\n\n*Student Choice (Ad)*\n\n#### Writing a Commercial Video Script\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDlUVbQTsso >}}\n\n### Story Analysis Workshop\n\n# October 8, 2024 (Tuesday)\n\n## Schedule for Today\n\n-   Storytelling Ethics\n-   Research Logs\n\n### \n\n### Storytelling Ethics\n\n#### Telling Stories from Real Life\n\n-   Queensburg and Brooks (2010) Recommendations\n\n![](images/ethics-of-stories.png){fig-alt=\"cover page chapter on ethics of stories in queensburg and brooks, 2010\"}\n\n-   Henrietta Lacks Example\n\nTrailer for Film\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jxEX1XQpY >}}\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jxEX1XQpY>\n\nExcerpt\n\n![](images/immortal-henrietta-excerpt.png){fig-alt=\"page from immortal life of henrietta lacks book\"}\n\nDialect\n\n::: callout-note\n## \"I’ve done my best to capture the language with which each person spoke and wrote: dialogue appears in native dialects; passages from diaries and other personal writings are quoted exactly as written.\n\n## As one of Henrietta’s relatives said to me, 'If you pretty up how people spoke and change the things they said, that’s dishonest.

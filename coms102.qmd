### Speech Ethics

#### Ethical Frameworks

-   Rule-based
-   Value-based
    -   What are your personal speech values? (5 minutes - write and share)
-   Outcome-based

#### Civility across Cultures

-   What is civility?

    ::: callout-note
    ## "What does 'civility' mean? It certainly means avoiding the use of swear words and other inflammatory language. It means treating opponents--even those you staunchly disagree with -- with respect. It means listening to them, and seriously thinking about what they have to say before one either rejects it or accepts it. It means treating people the way you want to be treated--even IF they don't treat you that way in return."

    Heidi and Guy M. Burgess, blog post, <https://www.beyondintractability.org/ttdth/civility>
    :::

-   Other contexts:

    -   Legal contexts - US Courts - <https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/practicing-language-civility-civil-discourse-and>

    -   Chinese press conferences - Ministry of Foreign Affairs - <https://jefferson.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_crossref_primary_10_1016_j_dcm_2020_100428&context=PC&vid=01TJU_INST:01TJU_EastFalls&lang=en&search_scope=EastFallsALL&adaptor=Primo%20Central&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,A%20discursive%20approach%20to%20disagreements%20expressed%20by%20Chinese%20spokespersons%20during%20press%20conferences>

        -   negative tone based on moral values of sincerity (诚/chéng) and frankness (实/shí)

        -   collective stance in response to accusation by French Foreign Ministry that China is unfairly treating Canadian nationals in custody

            ::: callout-note
            ## "As to the relevant French statement you mentioned, we firmly reject and oppose it. …… I cannot understand why the French side issued such a statement and why it is speaking on behalf of Canadian nationals. This has left a very bad impression on the Chinese people: France only cares for Canadian people and does not care for Chinese people."

            Mao and Zhao, 2020, journal article on the discursive approaches of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
            :::

#### Plaigarism

### Compelling Stories

-   Why tell stories at work?

    -   Influence the meaning of facts

    -   Trust and Faith helps the work outlast you

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## "Before anyone allows you to influence them, they want to know, “Who are you and why are you here?” If you don’t take the time to give a positive answer to these questions, they will make up their own answers – usually negative. It is human nature to expect that anyone out to influence others has something to gain. Most people subconsciously assume your gain will mean their loss. This is human nature. We instinctually erect barriers and suspicions to protect ourselves. You need to tell a story that demonstrates you are the kind of person people can trust. "
:::

*The Story Factor* (p. 3)

-   Compelling Story Strategies

```         
1.   Story first, facts after
```

```         
2.   Less is More - distill to key points
```

![](images/less-is-more-building.png)

<https://www.dwell.com/article/ludwig-mies-van-der-rohe-architect-19dd30ba>

```         
3.  Storyboarding to focus on the "wood" not the trees
```

![](images/storyboarding-medium.png)

Marketing Example - <https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-storyboard-experiences-fc051e2bc04d>

Multimedia Journalism Example - <https://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/start-to-finish-storyboarding/>

```         
4.  Use imagery
```

*Version 1*

A young child accidentally splashed bleach into their eye while playing. The child cried out in pain, but their older sibling hesitated to seek help. They were worried that they would get in trouble for not watching the child closely enough. After a few tense moments, they decided to rinse the child’s eye with water instead of going to the emergency room.

*Version 2*

In a bright kitchen, a young child accidentally splashed bleach into their eye, the sharp sting making tears flow down their cheeks. The air filled with the harsh smell of chemicals as the child cried out in pain. Their older sibling stood frozen, heart racing, torn between the urgency of seeking help and the fear of getting in trouble for not watching closely enough. The clock ticked loudly, each second stretching painfully as they weighed their options. Finally, with a deep breath, they rushed to the sink, turning on the cold water, hoping it would wash away both the bleach and their worries.\

Excerpt

![](images/immortal-henrietta-excerpt.png){fig-alt="page from immortal life of henrietta lacks book"}

Dialect

::: callout-note
## "I’ve done my best to capture the language with which each person spoke and wrote: dialogue appears in native dialects; passages from diaries and other personal writings are quoted exactly as written.

## As one of Henrietta’s relatives said to me, 'If you pretty up how people spoke and change the things they said, that’s dishonest. It’s taking away their lives, their experiences, and their selves.'

## In many places I’ve adopted the words interviewees used to describe their worlds and experiences. In doing so, I’ve used the language of their times and backgrounds, including words such as colored.

## Members of the Lacks family often referred to Johns Hopkins as 'John Hopkin,' and I’ve kept their usage when they’re speaking. Anything written in the first person in Deborah Lacks’s voice is a quote of her speaking, edited for length and occasionally clarity."

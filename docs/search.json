It is human nature to expect that anyone out to influence others has something to gain. Most people subconsciously assume your gain will mean their loss. This is human nature.

The air filled with the harsh smell of chemicals as the child cried out in pain. Their older sibling stood frozen, heart racing, torn between the urgency of seeking help and the fear of getting in trouble for not watching closely enough. The clock ticked loudly, each second stretching painfully as they weighed their options. Finally, with a deep breath, they rushed to the sink, turning on the cold water, hoping it would wash away both the bleach and their worries.\n\n\nStoryboard Exercise\n\nFinish the above story with an ending of your choice\nFocus on imagery you want to evoke reader / viewer / listener senses\n\n\n\n\nTalk about Story Analysis Assignment\n\nSee Canvas"

It’s taking away their lives, their experiences, and their selves.’\n\n\nIn many places I’ve adopted the words interviewees used to describe their worlds and experiences. In doing so, I’ve used the language of their times and backgrounds, including words such as colored.\n\n\nMembers of the Lacks family often referred to Johns Hopkins as ‘John Hopkin,’ and I’ve kept their usage when they’re speaking. Anything written in the first person in Deborah Lacks’s voice is a quote of her speaking, edited for length and occasionally clarity.”"
